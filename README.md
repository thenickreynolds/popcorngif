# Popcorn GIF

The extension is just the extension folder, a simple hand written file that shows a popup and then displays the searching site via an `iframe`.

The site itself is under `app` - updates there can be pushed to master and will be automatically deployed to https://popcorngifsearch.com by Vercel.
